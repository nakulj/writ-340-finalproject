The advantages of such a traffic calming measure include:\begin{itemize}
	\item Forces traffic to slow down, improving pedestrian safety.
	\item Draws attention to the pedestrian, especially when combined with signage and markings.
	\item Makes crossing the street easier for those on wheelchairs.
\end{itemize}

The drawbacks are:\begin{itemize}
	\item The textured materials used tend to be expensive.
	\item Not suitable for emergency or bus routes.
	\item Drainage, especially in snowy or rainy areas, requires additional management.
\end{itemize}
