The team is composed of three engineering students from the Viterbi School of Engineering and one international relations student from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences at the University of Southern California.  In the fall of 2013, Community Health Councils, Inc. (CHC) approached us to assist them a project of our choosing.  After consulting with Gabriel Stover, the Director of Research and Evaluation, and Alex Campbell, the Mobility Policy Analyst, we decided to work with them to get ``complete street‚Äù policies adopted by the City of Los Angeles.  Complete streets allow for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportation users to comfortably utilize streets.  Additionally, CHC is pushing for physical changes to streets to improve their use by pedestrians and transit users.  We agreed to research complete street practices that have already been proven to be effective in other cities and countries.  From this research, we aimed to provide CHC with valuable information and insight into practices that could work well here in South Los Angeles.  From this information, CHC would be better positioned to make policy recommendations to the City that could be implemented to improve the pedestrian experience.
